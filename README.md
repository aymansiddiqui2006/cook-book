# cook-book
This is my first web project — a responsive recipe book built with HTML and CSS. It displays different dishes using stylish cards with images, ingredients, and instructions. Features include hover effects, gradients, and mobile-friendly design, showcasing my basic front-end learning and implementation.



🍳 Ayman’s Recipe Book

This is my first web development project, created using HTML and CSS to apply what I’ve learned so far. The project is a simple and visually appealing recipe book website that displays different recipes using a clean card-based layout.

🚀 Features

📖 Recipe Cards: Each card shows a dish with an image, ingredients, and instructions.

🎨 Modern Styling: Used linear gradients and soft colors to match a food-inspired theme.

💻 Responsive Design: Built using Flexbox and media queries to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile screens.

✨ Hover Effects: Interactive animations on images and cards to make the design lively.

🖼️ Image Overlay: Each image shows a “CLICK HERE TO BUY NOW” overlay on hover.

🔔 Welcome Alert: A small JavaScript alert welcomes users when they open the website.

🧱 Implementation Details


HTML: Used to create the structure of the page, including navigation, recipe sections, and footer.

CSS: Used to style the entire layout, add gradients, spacing, hover effects, and responsiveness.

Flexbox Layout: Ensures recipe cards are evenly spaced and wrap properly on smaller screens.

Media Queries: Adjust layout for mobile view by stacking content vertically.


📱 Responsive Design Example

On large screens, recipes appear side by side.

On mobile devices, each recipe card stacks vertically for better readability.
